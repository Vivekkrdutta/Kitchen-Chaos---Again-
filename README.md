# 🍴 Kitchen Chaos Again

A Unity game inspired by [**Code Monkey's Kitchen Chaos tutorial**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275820/Kitchen_Chaos__Learn_Game_Development/).  

This project is a simplified Overcooked-like game where the player prepares and delivers meals to customers. ✨ Extended with **multiplayer (NGO + Unity Relay + Lobby)** and an improved **scoring & delivery system**. The Player can now deliver directly to customers waiting at their tables !
